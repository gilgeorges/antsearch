The project [CHP-swarm](http://www.chpswarm.ethz.ch) investigates the potential of decentralized, biogas fueld CHP (Combined Heat and Power) plants to provide balancing power for fluctuating PV (PhotoVoltaics) loads.
Among other things, at the ETHZ-LAV Energy Systems Group, we are charged with selecting suitable production sites.
That amounts to a combinatorial optimization problem, constrained by the regionally limited biogas potentials, the heat demand at intended installation sites and grid constraints.

This repository is home of a side-project in which we explore ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) as a promising means to tackling said and similar problems - essentially, we aim at non-linear optimal design of energy systems.
Please refer to the [included notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gilgeorges/antsearch/blob/master/AntSearch%20for%20CHPswarm.ipynb) for a more verbose introduction and the main ideas behind the project.
